### **Project Description**  
This is a simple React app for practicing the game of Blackjack. Note that it is not meant to be a Blackjack game, but a visually engaging tool for repeated hand evaluation. The user can study a decision matrix, or simply drill. A session score is displayed after each decision. It is best suited for a mobile screen.
